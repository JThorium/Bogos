# AstroAnnihilator Reborn - Current Status & Task Analysis

## 🚀 Server Status
✅ **Vite development server is running**
- Dependencies installed successfully
- Ready for development and testing

## 📋 Current Implementation Status

### ✅ What's Working Well
1. **Project Setup & Infrastructure**
   - Vite + React + Three.js + R3F setup complete
   - Tailwind CSS configured
   - Basic project structure in place

2. **Game State Management**
   - `GameProvider.jsx` with comprehensive state management
   - LocalStorage persistence for high scores, credits, upgrades
   - UFO selection and unlocking system

3. **Basic Game Loop**
   - Frame-rate independent movement using `delta`
   - Player ship movement following mouse
   - Basic enemy spawning and movement
   - Bullet system with collision detection
   - Score tracking and health system

4. **Entity System**
   - `GameEntity.jsx` base component (currently wireframe, needs solid rendering)
   - `PlayerShip.jsx` with basic controls
   - `EnemyShip.jsx` with movement patterns
   - `Bullet.jsx` components
   - `BombPickup.jsx` system

5. **UFO Data**
   - Comprehensive UFO data structure with 16 different ships
   - Enemy models defined with geometry and colors
   - Boss models and asteroid models defined

6. **UI Components**
   - Main menu, hangar, game over, pause menu screens
   - Basic HUD showing score and health

### ⚠️ Immediate Issues to Address

#### **Phase 1: Critical Rendering Fix**
1. **Solid 3D Models Instead of Wireframes** (URGENT)
   - Current `GameEntity.jsx` uses `wireframe: true`
   - Need to switch to `meshStandardMaterial` without wireframe
   - This is essential for visual fidelity and performance

#### **Phase 2: Core Gameplay Mechanics**
2. **Player Controls Enhancement**
   - ✅ Mouse movement working
   - ⚠️ Hold left click for abilities (partially implemented)
   - ❌ Double click for bombs (needs refinement)
   - ❌ Right click for hangar (basic implementation exists)
   - ❌ Mobile touch controls (placeholder code exists)

3. **Advanced Enemy Behaviors**
   - ✅ Basic movement patterns
   - ❌ Type-specific behaviors (weaver sine wave, dodger evasion, etc.)
   - ❌ Enemy shooting patterns
   - ❌ Advanced enemy types (splitter, stealth, etc.)

4. **Player Abilities System**
   - ⚠️ Basic ability framework exists
   - ❌ Most abilities not fully implemented
   - ❌ Visual effects for abilities missing
   - ❌ Proper cooldown and resource management

5. **Advanced Collision & Physics**
   - ✅ Basic bullet-enemy collisions
   - ✅ Player-enemy collisions
   - ❌ Proper bounding box calculations for all entity types
   - ❌ Advanced collision scenarios (powerups, obstacles)

#### **Phase 3: Missing Game Systems**
6. **Powerup System**
   - ❌ Shield powerups
   - ❌ Minion powerups  
   - ❌ Ghost powerups
   - ❌ Raw material pickups

7. **Obstacle System**
   - ❌ Asteroids
   - ❌ Black holes with gravity effects

8. **Wave Management**
   - ❌ Proper enemy spawning based on score/wave
   - ❌ Boss spawning system
   - ❌ Difficulty progression

9. **Visual Effects**
   - ❌ Particle system for explosions
   - ❌ Screen shake effects
   - ❌ Ability visual effects
   - ❌ Thruster effects

10. **Audio System**
    - ❌ Tone.js integration
    - ❌ Sound effects
    - ❌ Background music

## 🎯 Priority Task List

### **HIGH PRIORITY (Next 1-2 Hours)**
1. **Fix Solid Rendering** - Change `GameEntity.jsx` to use solid materials
2. **Enhance Enemy Behaviors** - Implement type-specific movement patterns
3. **Complete Player Abilities** - Implement remaining ability effects
4. **Improve Collision Detection** - Fix bounding boxes and add missing collision types

### **MEDIUM PRIORITY (Next 2-4 Hours)**  
5. **Add Missing Game Systems** - Powerups, obstacles, wave management
6. **Visual Effects** - Particles, explosions, screen shake
7. **UI Polish** - Better HUD, improved menus

### **LOW PRIORITY (Future)**
8. **Audio Integration** - Tone.js sounds and music
9. **Mobile Optimization** - Better touch controls
10. **Performance Optimization** - Object pooling, instancing for particles

## 🔧 Technical Considerations

### **Performance Notes**
- Current code uses object reuse for collision detection (`_vector3`, `_playerBox`, etc.) ✅
- May need object pooling for bullets if count gets high
- Particle system will need instanced rendering for good performance

### **Architecture Notes**
- Good separation between game logic and rendering ✅
- State management is well organized ✅
- Component structure is clean and modular ✅

## 🎮 Testing Recommendations

1. **Basic Functionality Test**
   - Start game and verify player movement
   - Test enemy spawning and collision
   - Verify score and health tracking

2. **Control Testing**
   - Mouse movement responsiveness
   - Ability activation/deactivation
   - Menu navigation

3. **Performance Testing**
   - Monitor frame rate during intense action
   - Check for memory leaks during extended play

## 📝 Next Steps

The game has a solid foundation and is approximately **40-50% complete**. The most critical next step is fixing the wireframe rendering to show solid 3D models, followed by implementing the remaining player abilities and enemy behaviors. The architecture is well-designed, making it straightforward to complete the remaining features.

**Ready to begin implementation! 🚀**
