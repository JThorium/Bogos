// Unit tests for the Hunting Game.
// Note: More advanced testing for canvas-based games typically requires a dedicated testing framework
// and a headless browser environment (e.g., Jest with JSDOM, Playwright, Puppeteer).
// The previous simple assertion library and tests are no longer directly applicable to the new
// canvas-based game structure.
